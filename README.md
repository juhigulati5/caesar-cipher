This code takes in a message input from the user and either encrypts or decrypts it, based on the users request. The encryption is a simple shift method by a user-determined number of letters, and can include spaces, numbers, and symbols without changing them. For example, "meet me at 3" with a shift of 1 becomes "nffu nf bu 3."
